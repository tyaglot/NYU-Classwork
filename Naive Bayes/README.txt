Naive Bayes
The following files should be in this directory:
NB.java
stopwords.txt
corpus.txt

To run the program, have the two text files in the same directory as NB.java, compile NB.java, and run it, giving it the command line input of an integer number which is used to determine how many of the entries in the corpus to train on.
