README
To run the code, compile the main file main.java (ie. "javac main.java")
Then run it with the path to the grammar and lexicon, in that order, followed by the input sentence as command line arguments. (ie. "java main grammar.txt lexicon.txt fish swim in streams")
The grammar and lexicon should be in the same format as those provided on the course webpage. They have been provided along with the source code but any grammar and lexicon following their structure should work with the code.
The following files should have been given in the same directory as this README file:
main.java, grammarNode.java, lexNode.java, nonTerm.java, Tree.java, grammar.txt, lexicon.txt, output.txt
